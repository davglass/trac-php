h2. Trac-PHP

The goal is to make a PHP frontend to Trac. Python is pretty slow on Apache and Trac is
really hard to customize.

This is only a proof of concept..

Currently it:
    Parses the trac.ini config file
    Intercepts a request and intantiates a Module Class


PEAR Packages:
    * sudo pear install Text_Wiki
    * sudo pear install Text_Wiki_Doku-0.0.1
