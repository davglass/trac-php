h2. Trac-PHP

The goal is to make a PHP frontend to Trac. Python is pretty slow on Apache and Trac is
really hard to customize.

This is only a proof of concept..

Currently it:
* Parses the trac.ini config file
* Intercepts a request and intantiates a Module Class
* Default template display
* Most pages are dispatched and rendered.
* Some wiki pages are parsed (Needs a MoinMoin parser written in PHP)
* Ticket class works, fetch, change & save including history


PEAR Packages:
* sudo pear install Text_Wiki
* sudo pear install Text_Wiki_Creole


NOTE: CSS, Images, File Structure and Config files are from the Trac Project By Edgewall Software. http://www.edgewall.org/
