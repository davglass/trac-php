h2. Trac-PHP

The goal is to make a PHP frontend to Trac. Python is pretty slow on Apache and Trac is
really hard to customize.

This is only a proof of concept..

Currently it:
    Parses the trac.ini config file
    Intercepts a request and intantiates a Module Class
    Default template display
    Most pages are dispatched and rendered.
    Some wiki pages are parsed


PEAR Packages:
    * sudo pear install Text_Wiki
    * sudo pear install Text_Wiki_Creole
